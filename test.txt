Mythological or not , it has to be emphasised that he was speaking here of a group of poets Ellenborgen , Hine , Mandel , Purdy , Macpherson , Layton and Cohen not just Leonard himself . But he clearly places Leonard within this group which , he held , grasps at a confusion of symbolic images , often a ragbag of classical mythology , in the effort to organise a chaos too large for them to deal with in the light of reason , which in turn causes them to express a sardonic bitterness in their social criticism , a realism without any utopian idealism to support it .

begin.v 0 0 0 0 0 @ It follows that if you can deliver an effective and continuous attack , your chances of scoring are higher than when you throw a single technique . When putting a combination together , take account of the distance you are from the opponent and whether this will alter as the combination progresses . Thus , if you @begin@ with a kick and land in a forward position , a second kick will be inadvisable unless the opponent has maintained a constant distance from you . Similarly , if you advance with a rapid sequence of punches , there is little point in throwing a kick unless the opponent has back - pedalled faster than you have advanced . You may find that distance closes quickly during a combination sequence and you and your opponent end up facing each other within reverse punch range .

This was done by asking them to report the position of a dot moving round an oscilloscope screen at the moment of the experience .

Subtracting these 200 msec from the 550 msec by which the RP preceded the movement , Libet concluded that the neural activity associated with an apparently voluntary act began some 350 msec before the first moment at which the subject was aware of his intention to act . So , he argued , the cerebral initiation of a spontaneous voluntary act begins unconsciously ( Libet , 1985 ) .

If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content ( and see Dennett , 1988 , for some powerful @arguments@ that it is not ) , then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena .

Because BS knows all the facts about the brain state , and the experience just is the brain state , then what the experience is like must be something other than a fact about the experience . The @argument@ transposes , however . Since merely knowing the brain state does not reveal what the experience is like , and since what the experience is like , if it is a reality at all ( which Tye does not dispute ) , must be a fact about the experience ( or a feature or aspect of the experience , which will do just as well ) , it follows that the experience is not a brain state .

When Keynes 's memorandum was discussed in Cabinet in February 1946 , defence expenditure for 1946/7 had already been cut by 14 per cent . But there was a marked reluctance to accept that the situation was as serious as Keynes portrayed it ( a portrayal broadly supported by a paper from the Balance of payments Working party ) .

Successful Science The sceptic might , at this point , complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position , I have not provided any convincing @arguments@ as to why one should believe it .

Scholes 's case is the more telling in that he is far from being a conservative opponent of all recent developments in theory ; he has written favourably of structuralism , and unsympathetically about fictional realism ( for which , indeed , he has been attacked by Tallis ) , and elsewhere in Textual Power he finds deconstructive reading as opposed to the theory underlying it a useful critical method . The @arguments@ of Tallis and Scholes against a major aspect of poststructuralist theory and practice should be attended to on the level at which they are advanced . But one rather doubts if they will be .

Nor , more abstractedly , could it be the result of a perspective on the informational content of the brain ; for , in either case , the perspective would have to be the occurrence of some further brain or informational state and to both of these the scientist has complete access , and the problem reoccurs .

In this light , @arguments@ about Derrida 's meaning have the fascination and intractability of @arguments@ about the interpretation of , say , Eliot 's poetry . Indeed , it is a central assumption of deconstruction that the distinction between literature and philosophy is exaggerated , or arbitrary , or even meaningless . Certainly , some of Derrida 's later work , such as The Post Card , looks more like experimental literature than philosophy in the normal sense .

argument.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ As I have remarked , Culler 's Structuralist Poetics encouraged some readers to think in terms of rapprochement between the New and the Newer Criticism .

The largest fixed - rate offering ever witnessed in the Eurobond market , a 1.5bn five - year deal announced on Friday for Italy , which used the new money - making formula , provides disturbing evidence however that excessive competition , born of over - capacity , could yet ruin the latest attempts at restoring profitability to the market .

What was interesting about that was that at the time John Brown got into financial difficulties the banks and institutional shareholders took a tough but very constructive view that it was worth helping the company through a reconstruction rather than forcing it into liquidation , which had been an attitude prevalent some years earlier . It was in fact my experience of working with the @banks@ and institutions for the recapitalisation and reconstruction of John Brown which led me to think that the City is much maligned over its attitudes to industry and the accusation of short - termism is not justified .

The variation between English - language speakers about what syllables , in effect what vowels , they treat as long or short , is so great that there can be no question of imposing on English verse a quantitative metre such as was used for ancient Latin ( doubtless with some strain for those who spoke classical Latin with dialectal variations as to quantity ) .

Not just unmetrical poets like Pound ( for the most part ) and Bunting , but also a strictly metrical poet like the later Yvor Winters , came to think that the finest auditory effects in English - language verse were attained by those poets who attended to the quantitative elements in British or American speech as an incalculable dimension super - added to the recognized and calculable dimensions of syllable - count and stresscount . Quantity in this sense , duration , is what musicians and musical composers are continually concerned with ; and so it is not surprising that poets of this way of thinking , like Pound and Bunting , show themselves avidly interested in poetry which has been , not at a level of theory but as a fact of performance , intimately associated with music : poetry that has been set , or has been written in the hope of being set , to music .

Ernest Newman 's remarks stress that choreographers creating dance to their own choice of music must study how the composer has structured his score and try to understand what he intended the @audience@ to hear and feel , whether it be played , or played and sung .

A feature of such stories is their selectivity , for they omit to mention the number of part - time reserve police who are unemployed or in low - status employment , or who sign up for mercenary reasons or for the power and respect that they believe accompanies the uniform . But even those who said they joined in order to serve the community ( and there are many ) feel a disappointment upon entering the force as a result of the limited opportunities for this allowed by their duties .

Is it to set the general atmosphere and mood as Stravinsky did for The Firebird Mysterious sounds of the wind whispering in the trees , the soaring flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot are still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale . On the other hand , Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and @audience@ to follow the unfolding of the plot . He contrasts the love themes of Romeo and Juliet with those which accompany the bitter struggles and fights between Montague and Capulet . Differently again , the overture to A Month in the Country conveys romantic nostalgia with deeper hints of passion which Lanchbery created when he arranged little - known music by Chopin .

audience.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ IT SEEMS that even in its own time the thirteenth - century motet was considered by many to be a sophisticated , subtle genre , only likely to appeal to the literati . That these generally complex , polytextual pieces can today appeal to an almost capacity house at the Wigmore Hall is largely due to two factors : the superb singing of Gothic Voices , and the ability of their director , Christopher Page , to unlock the musical secrets of the past . Over the years , Page has established himself as a medieval raconteur , delighting his audience with tales of , say , thirteenth - century Paris ; but anecdotes aside , he has also been refining the presentation and programming so that , almost without realising it , his @audiences@ learn a good deal about the often totally unfamiliar music being performed . This concert , part of the Early Music Centre Festival , was one of the most overtly educative so far , with even , at one point , an illustrated guide to composing a motet in five easy stages . Yet there is nothing condescendingly didactic in Page 's manner , nor anything textbookish about Gothic Voices ' performance .

The other characters were a sold - out leftie academic ( who drew much knowing laughter from the first - night @audience@ ) , a right - wing academic , a military automaton , and an Amstrad word - processor which enigmatically took the floor in a central scene . The script cut from psychiatry to politics to history to Euro - moralising with dizzy speed ; film - clip collages of Hitler saluting , Hess ( or not - Hess ) in the mortuary , hamburger ads , crumbling buildings , a screaming man in seventeenth - century dress , and the widow miming Hess 's improbable suicide all chimed in an unholy jangle with the events on stage .

The choreographer seizes on the personality of a particular dancer and creates ballets through which the dancer gradually develops and discloses unique talent and qualities to such a degree that @audiences@ soon recognise a star . The names of four choreographers immediately stand out . Taglioni recognised his daughter Marie 's quality of other worldliness in La Sylphide ; Perrot discovered Carlotta Grisi 's unique qualities as an actress - dancer in Giselle ; Fokine exposed Tamara Karsavina 's many - sided brilliance in such works as The Firebird , Le Carnaval and Petrushka ; Ashton fostered Margot Fonteyn 's varied personality .

These composers are not coldly exploiting their @audiences@ ' kindness ; they are all equally the victims of the going ideology . And sincerity is not in question .

audience.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ Perhaps the best example fur choreographers to study - is Petipa 's work for the corps de ballet , particularly in La Bayadre ( Scene of the Shades ) . As the thirty - six girls enter one by one down the ramp at the back of the stage and move into six straight lines across the stage until it is completely filled , there is one continually progressing line of arabesques and ports de bras . This demonstrates what can be done with two simple movements to hold an @audience@ 's attention . Later the mass of dancers merely moves upstage sur les pointes to a pose and further ports de bras , then returns downstage to another slowly unfolding set of ports de bras and arabesques . It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .
audience.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers ' behaviour will appear more spontaneous and natural . For example : each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a king or to the audience , nor end with another bow or considered pose ; but such behaviour may be included if the choreographer wishes to locate dance in a particular century and probably a palace in which the story unfolds . Many new members of an @audience@ have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow . It breaks the continuity of the dance . Other practices that once held up the flow of the dance were the continual closing in 5th position before a new step and the continual moving of the arms through 1st position at every change of weight or during a ports de bras .

When he arrived in America , Weill did not automatically expect New York ears to take to the music of the Berlin avant - garde in which he had played so prominent a part : instead he set himself the task of learning to write music with an American accent . Weill correctly perceived that the voice of the American nation was to be found in the musical , but as this form commanded no intellectual respect , the musical establishment has ever since accused him of selling out politically as well as musically .

And ballet must also have short phrase rhythms which will give it variety , dimension , mass , structure , texture and style . Perhaps no ballet has ever made the same impact on dancers and @audience@ as Stravinsky 's Rite of Spring . Its urgent overall rhythm commands the choreographer to keep the dancers moving forever onwards with greater intensity to the climax , whilst the shorter phrase rhythms give the Chosen Maiden and smaller groups such ways of moving that they hold the audience 's full attention until the fall of the curtain .

audience.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ But this introspective isolation , now compounded in so many cases by the fact that universities are the only institutions able to support a composer 's existence , perpetuates the sense that the only right path for a serious composer is the romantic path of high seriousness and absolute individual integrity . Robert Saxton , in these pages , recently denied that there was any longer a problem with contemporary music , and instead lectured the audience about paying closer attention . He did not mention that one definition of a composer 's talent is that he can write music that compels an @audience@ 's attention . If the Orphic myth defines the power of music , it is because Orpheus compelled an entirely hostile audience to listen to him. Mr Saxton also dismissed the idea of music as entertainment .

The White Paper on changes to the Scottish legal profession published yesterday by Malcolm Rifkind , the Secretary of State for Scotland , says that once trained , Scottish solicitors should have unrestricted rights of @audience@ in the higher courts , with the standard of performance achieved in training as the sole test . Any rule directly or indirectly restricting solicitors ' freedom to undertake all the actions necessary for the preparation and presentation of cases will need the approval of both the Secretary of State and the Lord President of the Court of Session . But in what the Law Society also interpreted yesterday as a clear shift in emphasis from the English proposals , the paper makes it clear that the role of the Lord President would be no different from the one he currently exercises when approving training and professional rules .

He bewildered his @audience@ for a moment , and then moved them , when he suddenly turned a political invective about government 's neglect of the environment into a lament that one of the sad losses was going to be the poetry of the countryside , the pastorals of a Vergil or a Theocritus .

Although the scores of The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker followed Petipa 's explicit orders that each item consisted of so many bars of one tempo and time signature and as to what it was supposed to represent , Tchaikovsky did demonstrate how ballet music could be developed symphonically by using the leitmotifs . He showed how music could flow through a scene and not be broken up into short numbers which encouraged the @audience@ to applaud each time . Stravinsky composed the first truly modern score for ballet with The Firebird ( see page 61 ) . He understood that there must be an overall rhythm as well as the phrase rhythms of particular leitmotifs and dances if dancers were to understand and feel properly Fokine 's choreographic design .

The dancers , however , get an obvious and infectious thrill out of performing Piano , and apart from its minor longeurs , it is an equally fresh and exhilarating experience for the @audience@ .

Indeed , with the exception of Atlanta 's Cable News Network , seen by a very small @audience@ in Britain , even the introduction of new television technology has so far only extended the reach ( if not the profitability ) of Britain 's existing press barons . Of course , it can be argued that readers get the paper that they want or deserve . As Whale ( 1977 , p. 84 ) argues : It is readers who determine the character of newspapers .

Jerome Robbins has a knack of using occupational gesture in many of his works and most particularly in The Concert , where the well - observed behaviour of the many different concert - goers arouses much laughter . Those in the @audience@ who have had to suffer such behaviour in a concert hall , whilst trying to listen to a brilliant musician , know that his remarks about certain characters are only too true . Whatever occupational gesture ( mime ) a choreographer chooses to use in ballet , it must be envisaged in terms of dance without the use of props . Even such mundane tasks as eating or drinking have found a place in some ballets .

He had an @audience@ : perhaps twenty people had gathered round the site , idly expectant , smoking and calling out . As the men at the windlass rope heaved and a long timber started to rise up and swing , the wheel on the pulley squealed like an injured dog and the man stationed at the top of the wall took a stickful of thick grease from a pot , leaned out , and worked it into the axle . Cameron pretended not to see young Donald till he was close beside him , then turned in mock surprise and said to him , Well well , Donald we had given you up.

They also opened the eyes of the @audience@ to the endless possibilities of expressing meaning through dance .

The @audience@ , transported with her , sat open - mouthed , oblivious to the rain pouring down their necks . This time , though , Ninagawa has brought over a Japanese classic . Suicide For Love is adapted by Matsuyo Akimoto from three plays by the 17th century writer Chikamatsu Monzaemon and Ninagawa 's production involves 73 actors , a swirling snow storm and a river on stage the company , with true Japanese courtesy , provide plastic macs for the first two rows of spectators .

As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself , and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for . Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the @audience@ into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effectively ) .

Sometimes students get anxious about this , and believe they are not making audience contact early enough ; but if you think about it , the reasoning is clear . Most of your technical tutors will be seeing everything you do , and deriving what they need to know from it ; they do n't want to find you confused by criticism from senior students which might not be helpful to you at this point .

But are there composers ready to seize this chance ? Many composers now crave the chance to write operas , but will they acknowledge the duty to communicate with the @audience@ ? There has always been a sense in which music is a secret , arcane , almost Cabbalistic , art . But this introspective isolation , now compounded in so many cases by the fact that universities are the only institutions able to support a composer 's existence , perpetuates the sense that the only right path for a serious composer is the romantic path of high seriousness and absolute individual integrity .

But Holland 's particular trademark is a cute and cloying sentimentality , with pathos laid on thick . Her story - telling has no obliqueness , no mystery ; everything is slowly and patiently explained , as though the @audience@ was a fidgety bunch of six - year - olds . The two directors have done their best , speeding the tale along on the wings of Bessie Smith and mouth - organ blues .

This is an exercise in persuasion , and requires composers who will focus their art on the simple and fundamental act of communication with their enthusiastic but tired , inattentive , restless , distracted and easily bored fellow human beings who none the less long to hear themselves in a not necessarily flattering mirror of music . Our society needs to be given the chance to hear its own heartbeat in its own music for pleasure first , then also for knowledge and understanding .

In addition to the courtesy the partners show to each other , there are also the courtesies that must be shown to the bystanders on stage during a pas de deux so that such reciprocation can help to focus the @audience@ 's attention on the context of the dance .

audience.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ Despite the great differences in style between the above three ballets and despite their different libretti the three choreographers perrot ( with Saint - Georges ) , MacMillan and Ashton give valid reasons why the tragic deaths of Giselle , Romeo and Juliet , and Natalia 's lost love are the inevitable result of what has gone before . In other words , what happens at the beginning of the story states why the relationships between two or more characters lead to confrontations which continue onwards to a climax and finally draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion . This last task is possibly the most difficult because the @audience@ must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before . The ending can also owe a great deal to the composer or arranger of music . Stravinsky ensures a happy yet solemn ending to The Firebird by using the old Easter hymn At the Gate where the whole congregation rejoices at the renewal of life .
audience.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ It is impossible exactly to define what is modern dance because the body is the same that has danced for hundreds of years . Choreographers cannot in any way change the ways in which their dancers move . The @audience@ recognise physical movement for itself alone whereas those who theorise and attempt to define what they mean by such terms as post or neo - modern , contemporary , avant - garde , etc. base their works on intellectual concepts which need to be discussed in words . Thus the audience fail to understand everything that is offered . Dance is firstly a physical activity and if it is obscured by complicated costumes , props , machinery , lighting and stage effects , it ceases to be relevant to anything but the cleverness of the producer .
audience.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ It is equally important when she is wearing a soft tunic or one - piece tights and leotard .

The tradition proved of crucial importance in forming the basis for the strategy of the alliance from 1911 until British recognition of their separate political claim in 1914 .

party.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ The decline of the labour element in the SDLP in the North , however , does indicate a trend to the style of politics in the Republic , that is towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance . The national question as such still remains a central preoccupation for catholic nationalists . Because the nation is seen as only partially liberated , and particularly by the membership of the largest @party@ Fianna Fil , the animus of the national - popular consciousness is focused on this issue , to the detriment of class - based politics . There has , therefore , been little chance in the past for a political growth of class consciousness among subordinate groups . What socialism there has been among the catholic nationalist tradition has always tended to be allied to republicanism , especially in the period 1913 to 1930 ( Rumpf and Hepburn 1977 : 13 ) .

Before the debate , Gerald Kaufman , the @party@ 's foreign affairs spokesman , criticised the resolution for its imprecision in not giving a time scale , and for ambiguity in not defining the precise level of spending required .

Loyalist @parties@ refused to join in , and the Provisional Sinn Fein was excluded by the fact that the ground rules for the forum only allowed parties accepting constitutional , nonviolent politics to participate . The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 . There was one vital breakthrough for the nationalist consciousness , though there still remains some doubt as to how deep this was for the Fianna Fil party : all the parties committed themselves to the recognition of the protestant loyalist group as having legitimate aspirations and affirmed the need for the recognition of two sets of legitimate rights coexisting in the island as a whole : Constitutional nationalists are determined to secure justice for all traditions

Yesterday Mr Kinnock presented a picture of a world changing so rapidly around the present government that the Prime Minister had become out of touch , out of date and out of step with the British people . As she enters her second decade in power , this promises to be an effective line of attack .
party.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ In both cases , democracy is invoked . But it is the theory of democracy as the right of the majority to rule which is seen as central , rather than democracy as the preservation of minority rights . In the North , the belief comes via the British parliamentary tradition of the two - @party@ system and its accompanying electoral process of first pass the post . For protestant loyalists , the majority means themselves . In addition , protestant loyalist politics has always been a zero - sum activity : one either has a monopoly of power or concedes it to the opposition .
party.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ From 1911 to 1914 , the Irish high clergy made successive attacks on the trade union movement and on socialism . Rumpf and Hepburn ( 1977 ) view the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limiting the appeal of socialism for the Irish subordinate classes until the 1950s . The emergence of a new pro - capitalist @party@ in the South from the end of 1985 , the Progressive Democratic Party , might show the extent to which political divisions based on the treaty and within the nationalist component of hegemony may have become problematic , to be partially replaced by an even more explicit concern with increasing the popular wealth and prosperity . Indeed , in the Irish general election of 1987 , progressive democrats took 14 seats , and 11.8 per cent of the total vote , which is sizeable for a young political party . The decline of the labour element in the SDLP in the North , however , does indicate a trend to the style of politics in the Republic , that is towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance .

party.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ The traditionalist camp has had to swallow some bitter pills . Oskar Lafontaine , the SPD leader in the Saarland , has argued vociferously that a modern mass party like the SPD could not afford to have its policies confined to the narrow interests of employed industrial workers . In the @party@ 's new programme , the trade unions have had to backtrack on their central demand , now accepting that a shorter working week will mean reduced wages . But Mr Lafontaine , standard - bearer of the up - and - coming generation , and the second most important figure after Mr Vogel on the committee drafting the party programme for the next decade , has certainly not had things all his own way . His attempts to link reductions in working hours to more flexible work practices , for example , have run into powerful union resistance .

But by the time he had gathered up her handbag and Lord Woodleigh 's camera , which had come to rest nearby , she was able slowly to make her way with them to the nearest point where the accident could be reported . Some two hours later the whole @party@ sat , exhausted and silent , in deckchairs on the terrace of Sven Hjerson 's hotel , sipping half - heartedly at cups of abominable tea and looking without seeing anything at the wide sweep of the Bay of Naples spread out far below them . Jilly Jonathan was pale but had calmed down after the bout of hysterical weeping that had overcome her once they had got her to the hotel . Peter Horbury sat beside her , still looking tousled from his exertions among the rocks .

But the Tories still have time to recover , especially if they jettison some of the more unattractive aspects of Thatcherism . Mr Kinnock 's job at conference must be to demonstrate Labour 's electability by confirming the @party@ 's new revisionism , by reassuring voters on issues where there is still doubt and , above all , by helping set the agenda for the 1990s . The party has abandoned policies which made it unelectable in the 1980s . It is no longer the party of traditional nationalisation ; it is no longer anti - European ; above all , it is no longer unilateralist .
party.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ This sort of language dismays the traditional ranks of SPD supporters , especially the big trade unions , who fear their voice within the party is being muffled . It has not always been easy for those working class voters who see the Greens as an undisciplined bunch , inimical to the interests of industrial society , to keep up with the SPD 's enthusiastic appetite for environmental matters . There has been a noticeable shift of working class support from the SPD to the far - right Republicans not as much as the losses from the Christian Democrats , but enough to worry @party@ managers . The differences in our electorate are much bigger than for the conservative parties , says Heidi Wieczorek - Zeul , a member of the party praesidium .

Even a Castle bishop such as Archbishop Healy , now announced his conversion to the nationalist cause . In other words , support for the education policies of the church were the quid the Irish party had to give in order to obtain the quo of the bishops ' endorsement of the party as the genuine political representatives of the Irish people or nation .

party.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ The Workers ' Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border . The provisional movement is divided on the issue of capitalism but , for the time at least , has an openly declared policy of achieving an island - wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process . The SDLP , still the main @party@ of catholic nationalists in Ulster , has dropped much of its socialist platform and maintains a delicate balance between nationalism and pragmatism in its politics . Despite frequently heard voices to the contrary , total catholic nationalist domination would be the likely outcome of a united Ireland unless a confederal structure were implemented . This is partly because of the structure of catholic nationalism in the Southern state and partly because the national unity sought by significant numbers of Northern catholic nationalists is still on the basis of the reversal of protestant loyalist hegemony rather than a power compromise .

He maintained there was only one way to resolve differences within the @party@ leadership over Labour 's policy towards a privatised water industry : Take water back without compensation . However , Mr Skinner firmly supported Neil Kinnock 's rejection of electoral pacts with other parties to help to defeat the Tories .

Fortunately for Hammersmith and its citizens , legal advisers for all @parties@ concerned have been unequivocal , all suggesting a defeat for the council , which would mean Hammersmith would not have to pay the losses on the transactions . The deals stretch back to 1983 when the council was run by a Conservative - Liberal coalition .

In this search for a new spiritual awareness , they like us were finding new possibilities to achieve a revived sense of what it is to be truly human in the transformational experience . This is basically the same anthropological journey pursued by Lvi - Strauss ( 1973 ) in Tristes Tropiques , which @remains@ a suitable precursor for most of the current reflexive ethnography . In this account , Lvi - Strauss uses the hero 's journey to self - analysis in the field as a means of achieving or engendering knowledge ( see also Caplan 1988 ) ; emphasizing that it is the journey to self - awareness itself , and not the arrival , which is the most important aspect of the rite de passage . The forces produced in the individual on such occasions , in what Jung ( 1964 ) calls a journey to individuation , manifest themselves in a number of very persuasive ways and in this case led to some radical reassessments of the existing moral , philosophic , political , and aesthetic order .

At first , the playing time for both @discs@ and cylinders was the same about two minutes but the fact that @discs@ could be made in different sizes , all of which could be played on the same machine , was another advantage . In 1901 it was found that a ten - inch disc ( playing for three minutes ) was better for most types of music , even popular songs , and the popular single was born . Although cylinder manufacturers countered effectively for some decades , first with moulding techniques and later with finer grooves , the overwhelming simplicity of being able to press thousands of copies of disc records and play them on a simple machine eventually told in the disc 's favour .

disc.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ There was no impetus to develop anything more sophisticated than a spoken announcement or a separate piece of paper packed into the box . This means that many cylinder records surviving today have highly dubious provenances , as we shall see later . It is debatable whether it was the cylinder or the @disc@ that was the first to have a formal label physically attached . At the 1890 Convention of Local Phonograph Companies in Chicago , delegates asked for a longer cylinder with a section specifically set aside for an announcement , but this did not come about . The following year there was a visit to the Edison works at West Orange , where the delegates saw prerecorded cylinders made by an experimental moulding process .

At first , the playing time for both discs and cylinders was the same about two minutes but the fact that discs could be made in different sizes , all of which could be played on the same machine , was another advantage . In 1901 it was found that a ten - inch @disc@ ( playing for three minutes ) was better for most types of music , even popular songs , and the popular single was born . Although cylinder manufacturers countered effectively for some decades , first with moulding techniques and later with finer grooves , the overwhelming simplicity of being able to press thousands of copies of disc records and play them on a simple machine eventually told in the disc 's favour . Certainly it became economic to pay recording artists large fees ; and without mass - production , few recordings of top artists would survive in playable form today .

Its performance exceeded that of contemporary @discs@ . Within three years , American broadcasters and record companies had abandoned discs as a mastering medium .

disc.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ There is an interesting story behind the SuperCut woodcarving disc for angle grinders . It has been launched by Toolbox of Sweden in direct competition to the Arbortech Woodcarver ; the principle of both tools being to imitate the action of chainsaw teeth , but in a safer , more versatile manner . Arbortech did so by developing a stamped @disc@ with a tooth shape that differs from the chainsaw , to make sweeping cuts possible . Its inventor Kevin Inkster started with a loose chain on a disc , and it is this formation that Toolbox have chosen . This move has been promoted as a safety measure , permitting slip when the tool bites , but the legalities of patent law were doubtless considered when Toolbox decided to manufacture their version .

It is a tribute to EMI engineers of the time and their faithful successors today that this and the even earlier ( 1937 ) version of Sibelius 's Fourth Symphony come up sounding so truthful ( CDM7 64027 2 ) . This @disc@ , running almost to 80 minutes , also includes his accounts of other Sibelius works Leminkainen 's Return , The Tempest and The Bard , all in authoritative readings . A favourite composer of Beecham 's was Berlioz , so it 's good to have back in circulation his famous 1957 performance of the Symphonie Fantastique with the French National Radio Orchestra ( CDM7 64032 2 ) coupled with the overtures King Lear , made with the RPO , and the pre - War and still vivid Carnival Romain with the LPO ; even if the recording of the last is a bit confined .

disc.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ The conventional paper label was never possible on a cylinder , since there was insufficient flat space . The end of the cylinder box had to suffice ( 27 ) , and paper labels were not attached to discs until 1901 ( 28 , left ) . It should be pointed out that they were nearly always pressed into the @disc@ at the time of manufacture , not pasted on afterwards ; so the paper and inks had to be able to withstand high temperatures . This is one reason why metallic inks , such as gold or silver , were common . In later years , paper labels served another function : they acted like gaskets , preventing molten material from getting into the mechanism for punching the centre hole .
disc.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ Longer - Playing Recordings Three factors ( size , speed , and groove - pitch ) might be manipulated to make long - playing records . And because @discs@ were on the market for a longer time , and attracted more investment , there are a correspondingly large number of freaks around . Probably the first long - playing disc records were made by the Neophone Company of London in 1904 ; they were twenty inches in diameter . The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures , but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each , and needed an outsize turntable .
disc.n 0 0 0 0 0 @ This speed was then adopted for Victor 's first long - playing records of 193134 . Although imperfect marketing has been cited by historians as the reason for Victor 's failure , in fact there may have been a simple operational reason . It was difficult enough to cut a perfect master 78rpm @disc@ with a duration of only five minutes . To cut a perfect long - playing side without stopping imposed intolerable demands on everyone . Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra ( again ! ) recorded Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony in this manner ; but Victor 's other LPs had to be patched - up dubbings from standard records , and they had a distinctly second - hand quality .

Rob Bettinson , the director , has deduced that he ought to have these images plus @disc@ - jockeys , radio commercials , midwestern hops , but he does n't seem to know why . Like most shows which are manufactured with an eye to commercial success ( Winnie , High Society , to name only Buddy 's predecessors at the Victoria Palace ) , this one will probably fail .

So much for the basic laws . The repeated confirmation of the correlation between the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the characteristics of the neural activity it triggers , and between the characteristics of the stimulus and that of the subjective sensation , has encouraged the belief that our sensations are in some sense to be understood in terms of a set of stimulation levels ( spiking frequencies ) in the appropriate sensory pathways .

appear.v 0 0 0 0 @ Were he to say any such thing we would be left with a therapeutic murder . But again Dostoevsky is fumbling after a creative or regenerative suffering , because it is of the essence of Raskolnikov 's questions , desires , feelings , and so forth ( which of course do appear in the novel ) that they should be agonized . The fictional morphology of this suffering is more aptly suggested by the novelist and critic Akhsharumov , writing the very year Crime and Punishment @appeared@ in hard covers , who observes that Raskolnikov 's mental torment , which is his punishment in all but its public aspect , begins with his first promptings towards the crime . Thus Akhsharumov directs the reader to something that makes him certain he holds a masterpiece in his hands before he has read half a dozen pages : a single pre - natal life , a foetal stirring and growth , no ordinary robust narrative sense of something afoot . Raskolnikov 's first thought on slinking down the lodging - house stairs is one of surprise at himself that he should be simultaneously in terror of his landlady and planning a murder .

My Proposition , embracing The House of the Dead , Notes from Underground , Crime and Punishment , The Possessed , Karamazov , and , negatively , by way of relative failure , The Idiot , is that Dostoevsky could only promote his dearest values by creeping up on their blind side : in other words that he had an urge towards crisis and clarity which he could only satisfy by yielding it to the enemy to the horror of the flogging routine in the Thy kingdom come episode in the Dead House at one chronological extreme , and to Ivan Karamazov 's showdown with the Religion Swindle at the other.

The solution to He was not really afraid of any landlady might appear to be that we have here a masked first - person avowal , and that it is simply an indication of Dostoevsky 's boldness that it should be surrounded by authorial statements which are firmly outside and ( so to say ) on top of Raskolnikov in the classical omniscient third - person mode : for example , information about his poverty , irritable frame of mind , withdrawal from society , his not naturally timorous and abject disposition .

In the end , the WICBC 's attitude that they could not accept any individual who did not uphold their tradition of sportsmanship prevailed , and Gilchrist played no more Tests . So far , with Worrell having turned down the chance , no one had been able to complain about the captaincy ; but by now Worrell had his @degree@ , was very much available , and Alexander himself expected him to be made captain for the tour by England in 195960 .

When asked if they would like subventions from the state to aid their stipends and church buildings , a move which was being seriously considered by the British government at the time , priests and bishops were united in rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people , identifying clergy with the principal enemies of the people . De Tocqueville 's notes reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people was , the @degree@ to which the poor , half the catholic population at the time , looked to the clergy for material and spiritual leadership , guidance , and assistance , and how much they trusted them . However , with the emergence of the Southern Irish state , it soon became clear that this secularization of the state form was not to signify an absence of Roman catholic power in the construction of public morality , but rather an indirect recognition of the sovereignty of the church in most areas of moral concern besides education . In fact , precisely because Roman catholic power was to be accepted as normative in an entirely natural way by the catholic nationalist population , the church 's part - active and part - passive acceptance of the capitalist system of government and thorough opposition to socialism had a significant legitimating function for the Irish state - form .

His fears seem to be well founded , for a move towards regionalization is now occurring , with a proposal that the forty - three forces disappear into perhaps eight or nine giant regional units .

For about 100 years Jewish and Christian scholars have demonstrated over and over again that the stereotype of the Pharisees found in the Gospels is a distortion which reflects the animosity of the Evangelists rather than the historical truth or even the attitude of Jesus himself . Far from being inclined towards self - righteousness , the Pharisees taught Be humble before all men , and revered their teacher Hillel for his extreme humility ; and far from being judgemental , they urged Do not judge your fellow man until you are in his position and Always judge others by the scale of merit ( that is , charitably ) .

Perennial weeds such as couch or coltsfoot are more difficult to control , and slugs , which @shelter@ and multiply in the deep , hard - sided slits , can become a serious pest . Winter cereals are slow to establish , and must be sown earlier : this is apparently because there is a tendency for stubble or killed turf to be pushed down into the slits with the seed where it can create anaerobic conditions leading to the formation of toxic substances such as acetic acid . But one might be forgiven for doubting if this is the most likely cause of the toxic side - effects of direct drilling !

climb.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Thus the pilots who are flying several different types of glider , or a glider which is unfamiliar to them , must ask themselves before each flight , Do I need the stick forward to lift the tail , or back a little to lift the nose ? With gliders which have a front wheel or main skid , a main wheel just behind the c.g . and a tail - wheel or skid like the K13 , Grob 103 , ASK21 , Puchazc , Schweitzer 233 and most of the older single seaters , it may be necessary to ease back a little during the take - off run to raise the front wheel or skid . A few seconds later as the aircraft gains more speed , it will need more forward movement to prevent it from unsticking with the tail - wheel or skid touching the ground , and @climbing@ away too steeply . When the main wheel is ahead of the c.g . so that the glider is sitting tail - down , a forward movement is needed to raise the tail a little for take - off . The exact movements required will vary depending on the amount of acceleration .

The tow pilot can help by allowing his aircraft to @climb@ away , gaining speed rather than holding it down close to the ground .

climb.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ It is possible that this has contributed to the risk of the glider zooming too high just after take off . In windy weather , the effects of the wind gradient near the ground accentuate any movement up or down of the towplane and glider . If the towplane gains speed by flying close to the ground , when it noses up to start @climbing@ , the effect of the wind gradient accentuates the climb so that the glider may easily be left flying close to the ground , in or near the wake and below the tug . Then , when the glider pilot recognises he is far too low , any quick movement to regain position takes the glider up through the same wind gradient , causing a sudden surge of speed and producing an unexpected and possibly uncontrollable gain of height . At the same time , the extra load in the tow rope accentuates the nose - up pitching movement on the glider ( as in a winch launch ) .
climb.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ The optimum speed for a launch depends on both the type of glider and the wind strength . A minimum safe speed for most gliders is the minimum cruising speed , but this is only safe at height , where there is time for recovery if a stall occurs . In windy conditions , the glider will @climb@ higher if the launching speeds are on the slow side , whereas on a calm day the best speed is closer to the limit shown on the placard . Special care is needed if the wings are wet when extra speed is necessary , because the stalling speed is raised . Often , on a small field the most critical situation will be a stop - go launch .

Sarsby , ( 1984 : 1301 ) echoing Cheater , points out that anthropologists have tended to study people whose values and life - styles are different , even in their own society seeking the unfamiliar at home as well as abroad .

However , Fforde 's acceptance of Dicey 's basic agenda reveals the weakness of his central argument , a weakness which is confirmed by his comment that the LPDL , an @organization@ with which Dicey had close links , espoused the pure milk of Conservative orthodoxy . Fforde 's error ( and Eccleshall makes the same mistake ) is simply that the orthodoxy which Dicey and his friends in the LPDL espoused was not Conservatism but classical mid - Victorian Liberalism .

Policing issues are never long out of the headlines ( Chibnall 1977 ) , and this media obsession has been transmitted into a wealth of analyses of policing which have mostly been carried out by outside observers .

For this reason the campaigning elements of the @organization@ and that includes many of the 80,000 British members who undertake to be active on Amnesty 's behalf have increased and refined their methods over the years .

Expectations of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reaching fruition , for as the revelations of Spycatcher ( Wright and Greenglass 1986 ) revealed , it is not necessarily what is written which causes the pain ; rather it is the breach of the convention which requires members in various @arms@ of the executive to say nothing about their practices . This returns us to Arendt 's observation that secrecy is a prerequisite of totalitarianism , for those involved in the executive use of power know that to reveal is antagonistic to its maintenance .

But the political significance of this culture is that where opinion counts and where the catholic nationalist remnant actually experiences the coercive power of protestant loyalists and the British army in the Northern statelet , there violence has all the more support . When it does , it tends to be a reaction to perceived injustice , such as internment without trial , or the conviction of a son by a sole judge in a trial held in total secrecy and on the evidence of unseen witnesses , or a simple case of one 's house being badly mauled by careless soldiers searching for @arms@ . This reactive violence is thus justified by its subjects and the justification subsists in consciousness along with their Roman catholic profession of faith and identity . The provisional IRA 's commitment to violence against the British and against the protestant loyalist alliance , which the provisionals rhetorically and conveniently subsume under the term the British , is frequently assumed to be based on either Marxist or nationalist principles and in both cases to be secularist or areligious .

expect.v 0 0 0 0 @ Research in the police , Irving further asserts , is a matter of pragmatics , eliminating philosophical enquiry into systems of belief , or how the knowledge of an ideology is transformed into action . In the end , only the action is viable , so that all these essays tend to match the inside ethnography and are nullified by neglect or have any contentious matter treated as privileged information , for as Templeton ( 1980 : 904 ) argues the police fear that if you have a better understanding of society , you are in a better position to change it the very exercise they are reluctant to engage in . Those who do go public are disloyal and there are thinly veiled attempts to dismiss the value of any revelation they make , for they are @expected@ to remain silent and uncritical . When Ronald Gregory , the ex - chief constable of West Yorkshire , said little or nothing new about the Yorkshire Ripper case in a series of newspaper articles , he was castigated in Police Review ( 1 July 1983 ) and they republished a 1979 photograph of him when his loyalty was unquestioned . John Alderson , the ex - chief constable of Devon and Cornwall has suffered even more from his subsequent public persona , because of a move into academia , some critical publications , and a flirtation with the political life .

Moreover , he must come to terms with a new awareness of what he has previously accepted , perhaps without thinking , which under the intense microscope of social enquiry may well seem to verge on the ludicrous or to be morally indefensible . And having long been supported by the institution he will be crucially aware that it @expects@ a degree of loyalty verging on deference or acquiescence . In such an archetypal world , where good is constantly and insecurely balanced in an eternal struggle against evil , the objective explication of the rituals and symbols which surround and mystify police work can seem tantamount to a treasonable act . In 1979 , James Anderton , the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester , described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy ( Thompson 1979 : 380 ) .

One explicit guiding principle of papal teaching which came to influence the Irish constitution and successive debates culminating in the church state imbroglio of 1951 , dealt with below , was that of subsidiarity : that no secondary institution such as the state should take on duties which primary and intermediate ones , such as the family , could assume . Secondary institutions were also @expected@ to assist primary ones in fulfilling their essential tasks . The principle took on particular importance in the light of the development of totalitarian communism , and the Roman church saw the threat to be endemic in the growth of the modern state apparatus , including its welfare institutions .

Always the police prefer to exhibit bodily constraint in their styles , for restraint and decorum have a symbolic history as an indication of subcultural insider purity , a comfort with a vanishing status quo , and a rejection of the changing outside world . This restraint @expected@ in police hair was clearly illustrated in a large poster exhibited in the Northumbria police training department in the early 1980s , which ordered : male hair will be clear of the collar and sideburns will not extend below the centre of the ear . Faris ( 1968 ) , exploring the way such symbols come to represent complex conceptual domains , coined the phrase symbols of high meaning capacity , which exactly fits the structural significance hair has for police ideology .

Will Clark , the Giants first baseman who narrowly @missed@ the 1989 batting championship with an average of .333 , drove in six runs with two homers - one a grand slam as San Francisco routed the Cubs 11 - 3 in the first game of the best - of - seven National League championship series at Wrigley Field . Rickey Henderson 's nerveless brilliance between the bases helped the Athletics beat the Blue Jays 6 - 3 in Oakland and earn a 2 - 0 lead in the American League play - off series . Henderson , traded this season from the New York Yankees , stole a post - season record four bases ( in one game ) and scored two runs .

Andrew Harrison @missed@ a straightforward chance from 25 metres . He missed with two other attempts , one from longer range and a sitter from 20 metres , failing to reward the efforts of his pack , who were considerably outweighed by the Lancashire eight . Cumbria threatened to fall apart when they lost their hooker , Derek Dougan , just before the interval , as Lancashire 's Mark Hesketh finished off a surge by Shaun Gallagher , initiated by the lively Dewi Morris , to give Lancashire a 9 - 0 lead at the break.

treat.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ One feature of English verse that is scanted by this method , or can be acknowledged only incidentally , is one that every careful reader knows from his or her experience : tempo , the speeding up or slowing down of enunciation , and therefore of apprehension , as we read through a line or through several lines in sequence . This seems to be intimately connected with another principle , which is more radical and therefore more important : that of quantity , of syllables as being , in relation to their contiguous syllables , either long or short . The variation between English - language speakers about what syllables , in effect what vowels , they @treat@ as long or short , is so great that there can be no question of imposing on English verse a quantitative metre such as was used for ancient Latin ( doubtless with some strain for those who spoke classical Latin with dialectal variations as to quantity ) . This granted , it remains true , as anyone 's experience of his own and others ' speech - habits will confirm , that some English vowels are experienced and expressed as relatively long , others as relatively short . Not just unmetrical poets like Pound ( for the most part ) and Bunting , but also a strictly metrical poet like the later Yvor Winters , came to think that the finest auditory effects in English - language verse were attained by those poets who attended to the quantitative elements in British or American speech as an incalculable dimension super - added to the recognized and calculable dimensions of syllable - count and stresscount .

In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 , while an extensive health bill was going through parliament , the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority , without qualification , is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family , the Church in education , the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions ( Irish Independent , 12 Apr. 1951 , quoted Whyte 1980 : 143 ) .

performance.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Admittedly , conditions in the American academy are a little tighter than they once were , but what looks like stringency by American standards is still lavishness by British ones . Britain can never hope to compete with all this . Nevertheless , professionalism on American lines is still the ideal that academic administrators uphold , since it can indicate to sceptical politicians and the public at large that universities are engaged in the visible activity which generates @performance@ - indicators . In this climate , the academic in English and other subjects in the humanities , who is busy , who publishes a lot , who goes to conferences , cannot but be preferred to the quiet scholar , who keeps a low profile , even seems rather idle , but is taking his time over a major piece of scholarly writing that may involve many years ' work and which he does not intend to give to the world until he is ready . Such people have in the past been left to go their own way without interference .

The better of them were for viola alone , including Brian Cherney 's Shekhinah , in its first @performance@ : this alternates furious tremolando , sudden violent attack , and wistful melody , invented or quoted . Cherney said ( in the only programme - note ) that he had been inspired by Golani 's bearing as well as her playing , and although the density of events was not high , the sense of concentration and unity between music and performer was total as the wilder elements were gradually exorcised and a numb calm remained . Prousse , by Jean Papineau - Couture , argued an intense and clearly delineated course from climax to climax : the most powerful of the evening 's compositions , and the one most likely to attract other players .

In his own beloved English , it was always higher , averaging 71.3 per cent in the three years he offered the subject ; French , which was only offered in his first year produced a convincing 75 per cent ; and Economics , offered in two years , 62 per cent . Philosophy , at 70 per cent , was significant ; but he barely squeezed by in Latin , taking a refusal at his second attempt and attaining a mere pass at the repeat stage ( thanks , no doubt , to his past opting out , which necessitated his taking Latin from scratch at university ) .

Working with an ensemble he had built in a hall whose construction he had supervised , he could afford to be as relaxed as he wished , and also as demanding . Rehearsals for important premieres , such as the first Polish performance of Shostakovich 's Fourteenth Symphony at an inaugural concert of the Warsaw Autumn , could take many weeks .

performance.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ As a star , Bette Davis was of the type commonly designated inimitable , which tends to mean ( as it did in her case ) that she eventually became the butt of countless imitators ; and these imitators merely accentuated symptoms of self - parody that were already detectable in her own screen presence . Though she was a performer of indisputable talent , one was none the less left with a nagging impression that overarching each of her individual characteristics was another role , one she played to the hilt : that of the grande dame , the First Lady of the American cinema , the Duse of the double - feature . At her worst which is to say , when her @performances@ , all crust and no bread , seemed little more than a rash of mannerisms she could strike one as impossibly tic - ridden and implausible . At her considerable best when her physical angularity , her fluttery , melodramatic flounces and her inclination to treat the most unpretentious line of dialogue as a conversation - stopper were tempered either by a real affinity with the role in question or else by a witty , self - deprecating sense of her own absurdity in it she remained one of the most consistently spell - binding of Hollywood stars . Before the phrase became fashionable , Davis was , on - screen , the epitome of the castrating female , her appeal as a cinematic icon being thus largely confined to the feminine ( and , by a probably logical extension , homosexual ) portion of her audience .
performance.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Then somebody let the livestock loose . If Les Negresses Vertes tend to jostle on the stage like animals being herded down a narrow street , it is partly because there are so many of them ( 11 , when all the strays are rounded up ) , but also because , even as the show begins , several key members appear to be too drunk to be capable of motion in a straight line . This might sound like irresponsibility , but , given how the @performance@ pans out , you could also read it as professional commitment ; the longer the show goes on , the more the drink goes down and , in a remarkable contradiction of physics , the tighter the playing becomes . In fact , midway through the first song , only the size of the band dissuaded you from buying a round to speed up the process . You only had to compare the opening version of Zobi la Mouche ( lumpy drums and shuddering halts ) with the neatly turned performance eventually wheeled out as an encore , to realise how this is a machine which runs the better for being well - oiled .

Edmund Barham makes Cavaradossi almost as formidable , a convincing aristocrat , tender with Tosca , arrogant with Scarpia , and sung with true tone and great power .

Klein , whose ages ranged from 40 to 60 ; Leonard was just 23 . ) In this film Leonard recorded eight poems from his recent book ( For Wilf And His House , Beside The Shepherd , Poem , Lovers , The Sparrows , Warning , Les Vieux and Elegy ) ; the sleeve was careful to emphasise that he also wrote songs for a local group called The Stormy Clovers , by no means his first such work . And he was now frequently called to other public @performances@ ; his first professional poetry recital was at Dunn 's Jazz Parlour in Montreal , where he recited Gift to piano accompaniment , in honour of the ancient traditions of poetry . Another event took place at Birdland , a jazz - club in the centre of Montreal , where Leonard gave poetry readings after midnight , frequently to the accompaniment of his own guitar on which he improvised appropriate backings , though often in company with more experienced jazz musicians . His early involvement in this so - called jazz - poetry which achieved such popularity in the sixties shows that Leonard , not for the first time , and certainly not the last , was where it was all happening before it actually happened .
performance.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ OPERA NORTH 's Tosca , first produced last year , is revived with a new conductor and two new principals , once again headed by the flame - haired Tosca of Mary Jane Johnson . If its dramatic focus seems different , it is because Carlo Rizzi 's tempi are rather faster than those adopted by Clive Timms ; the action progresses less with inexorability than by abrupt shifts of mood . Perhaps not every chord was quite in place , but this remains orchestrally an exciting @performance@ ; occasional poor balance between voice and stage emanates , I think , from the acoustic properties of the set . Johnson remains nearly ideal as the jealous , mercurial prima donna . Her powerful and eloquent singing really does not need to be supplemented by low - register Sprechstimme ; one can see the point , but Puccini is near enough to raw melodrama without such mannerism .

The @performance@ of Durga Lal in the title role is a masterpiece of versatility and concentration : his delirium at the end of the first act is nothing short of hair - raising . To say that the recipe is naive would be to miss the point , but with the predominance of so much dance , drama is often lacking .

The arabesque as a gesture changes to give some insight into the character 's moods , emotions and actions , as well as arising out of the rhythmic and melodic phrasing of the music . There is an obvious contrast in Ashton 's Enigma Variations between the youthful Dorabella 's playful and loving arabesques in front of Elgar and the arabesques of his Wife , which are calm and tenderly sympathetic when she dances with him.

One of the patients could not categorize the expression on faces that she was shown in photographs in terms of whether the expression was one of happiness , anger , surprise and so on .

And those with their ears to the dressing - room wall have yet to report rumbles . Toshack has taken pains to play down the hard - man image he brought from San Sebastian , swearing that the extra training ordered after the poor @performance@ at Castellon was not a punishment . While Real are unbeaten , the relative honeymoon will continue for a man whom the late Bill Shankly , with characteristic caution , once said was destined to become the top manager in the game . Toshack 's admiration for Shankly , who signed him for Liverpool from Cardiff in 1970 , is unquestionably deep : still the overwhelming influence on his career .

And with so much theatre training available in the United States , New Zealand , Australia and Canada , it is interesting to @ask@ why British theatre training is thought to be so beneficial . I can only put it down to the strong classical emphasis which prevails in the courses offered in the UK , although many of the university drama courses in the USA do stage Shakespeare and the European classical authors .

Should that unthinkable thing happen , and you forget your lines , do n't despair . A sympathetic panel may well @ask@ you to start again . But there is no trick to the business of learning lines , as you will find out as you go on although learning lines for an audition is different from memorising a part in a play for production , because then you will be operating with other actors around you . On the whole , acting in isolation is a peculiar feature of the audition system , which is why the pieces you choose in either the classic or modern text need to be reasonably well contained and lend themselves to being performed as a one man show .

Firstly , karateka are not allowed to bring their own coaches with them to training sessions because experience has shown that the presence of other coaches breaks up the training atmosphere , and causes people to separate to far corners instead of remaining together . The second point is that you may be @asked@ to take a drug test at any squad session . If you refuse , you will be treated as though you had failed the test , and you will face a lifetime ban . Thirdly , the coach is in the business of picking winners , not his friends , so if you have n't been selected , you have to admit to yourself that perhaps you did n't deserve to be .

ask.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ For example , checking the items in the wrong order is totally unacceptable because it can so easily lead to missing something out altogether . A re - check should never be necessary , since this only implies the acceptance of a half - hearted check in the first place . The idea of having the person attaching the cable @ask@ if the airbrakes are closed and locked has been introduced in some clubs to try and prevent incidents where pilots take off with their airbrakes unlocked . However , if you are going to re - check the airbrakes , it would seem logical to check all the items in the check - list as well . Many instructors are not careful , or thoughtful enough about either their initial teaching or their subsequent monitoring of their students as they do their own cockpit checks .
ask.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Nowadays , nearly every young person has probably had some experience of basic improvisation at their school or through the extensive TIE ( Theatre in Education ) tours . In drama schools , improvisation is about finding a way of expanding the imagination and liberating the senses , which can get too confined if students work entirely from a text all the time . The use of impro in training has gone through many phases ; it still conjures up the traditional , hackneyed image of a student being @asked@ to be a tree or an icecream . But it 's possible to go way beyond these limited , obvious exercises , and impro can be immensely exciting for young actors , allowing them to grasp situations and emotions imaginatively , perhaps for the first time . Here is an example of an impro exercise for two actors : An actor is asked to assume the character of a close family friend who arrives at the house with the news of the death of the wife 's husband in an accident .
ask.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ That 's why , said Tom . And she may not want to talk about it . Or have been @asked@ not to by her husband he put his arm round his wife . I think you 're forgetting something about old Locombe - Stapleford . She was close to tears now .
ask.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Furthermore , such pressures are limited , thus creating a situation where there has been hardly any research on the police compared with the large output of critical scholarship on industry , commerce , the civil service , the health service and education what little direct research there has been on the police has scarcely begun to ask such fundamental questions as what is the police force and what is it doing . This point ( Wojtas 1982 ) occurs in a description of a new research centre for Police Studies at Strathclyde University , which is to @ask@ whether anyone is doing research on the police , what degree of co - operation they have met and to encourage research by the police themselves . Once again , however , defensiveness won the day and when the Strathclyde Centre circulated forces asking them to co - operate in the venture , a decision was taken to withhold co - operation and a circular went round to this effect , suggesting the existing Home Office funded PRSU ( Police Research Services Unit ) and the Home Office Research and Planning Unit were adequate for the needs of the service . This latter unit ( formerly the HO Research Unit ) does provide some research material for those who seek it out and its bulletin is a reference source to recent government funded research , which is largely concerned with operational systems and the tools of policing .

Significantly , he adduced the work of the American poet Wallace Stevens at this point , a man torn between the profession of law and the poetic muse , whose view of lost faith and a disconnected tradition imbued his poetry with a wistfulness and a challenge that was taken very seriously by Leonard and Layton ; or , perhaps , viewed by them as a satisfactory replacement .

ask.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ The result is that the war against crime fought by detectives becomes a symbolic re - enactment of conflicts in the economic world at large , between those who have material property and power and those who labour and are dispossessed . Whether there is any social morality or justice in such a system is not a matter which the detectives are given to question ; nor do they spend much time in reflecting on why some dubious property acquisition is outside their terms of reference , or what the relationship is of such practices to the maintenance of position and power . In the main , they are instilled with the pragmatic games of pursuit they play with the local petty thief ; and if @asked@ to consider the wider nature of their role , they tend to fall back on protestations of political neutrality . This is another skewed reality , of course , for in their pursuit of the prig they are merely following a version of justice which depends on blind acquiescence to establishment values of honesty . Leach ( 1977 ) has shown the ephemerality which lies in any attempt to classify deviance on a global scale ; for what is criminal in one society or at one point in time is relative to that time and place and to who holds the discourse on power .
ask.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ We will see that this mode of constructing monopoly catholicism is alien to the Concordat period of Roman catholic church state relations recognizable in arrangements , for example , with Spain , Portugal , and Italy . A dislike by Irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church state relationship has a long tradition and comes out best in De Tocqueville 's ( 1957 ) conversations with Irish clergy on his visit to Ireland in 1834 . When @asked@ if they would like subventions from the state to aid their stipends and church buildings , a move which was being seriously considered by the British government at the time , priests and bishops were united in rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people , identifying clergy with the principal enemies of the people . De Tocqueville 's notes reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people was , the degree to which the poor , half the catholic population at the time , looked to the clergy for material and spiritual leadership , guidance , and assistance , and how much they trusted them . However , with the emergence of the Southern Irish state , it soon became clear that this secularization of the state form was not to signify an absence of Roman catholic power in the construction of public morality , but rather an indirect recognition of the sovereignty of the church in most areas of moral concern besides education .
ask.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Archbishop McHale , who opposed the non - denominational system , was hoping for a verdict to support his views . The verdict from Rome , which came in 1841 , favoured both and neither . It @asked@ the participants to stop haggling in public and permitted each bishop to take a decision either way for his own diocese ( Murphy 1959 ) . It is noteworthy that at this time ( when secularised education was patronised by nearly all the governments of Europe including those that were nominally Catholic ) this query was dealt with as a matter of discipline by the Congregation of propaganda , and not as a matter of doctrine by the Congregation of the Inquisition .

You will understand when you see its handsome dark green leathery leaves and startling gold - eyed daisies , their cerise - magenta ray florets in branched heads 11/2ft above the ground .

ask.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Statistically these deaths largely occur as a result of the inhalation of vomit and alcoholic poisoning , and it therefore seems somewhat bizarre for the police to be in charge of those suffering in such a way . More often than not the victims have serious medical problems , show a long history of social inadequacy , or are clearly suffering from mental illness . At the 1987 annual ACPO conference , chief officers complained they were still having to deal with this illness and @asked@ why do people still need to die in cells from inhalation of vomit ? In Chapter 3 I will describe in detail the culture created to deal with these street - visible offenders in a cell - block situation , but suggest the inertia surrounding the whole problem is more easily understood when we consider the social history of such illness ( Foucault 1967 ) , and see how the executive has always allocated the control of such drunken dossers to the police . As social dirt they become an affront to purity and possess the danger of the contagious and impure ( Douglas 1966 ) , requiring their removal from the public vision .

activate.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Hayward and his collaborators are among those to have reported this discovery in ANAS ( vol 79 , p 7842 ) ; they , and a collaborative team led by Bob Gallow of the US National Institutes of Health and Carlo Croce of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia , have shown that the myc gene is strategically placed at the breakpoint where the translocated fragment of chromosome 8 links up with chromosome 14 in lymphoma cells . At the same time , Phil Ledler , Stuart Aaronson and G. Lenoir have gone further and shown that in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells the myc gene becomes linked with DNA - encoding parts of the antibody molecule . But while these reports neatly confirm Kein 's and Hayward 's ideas about the activation of proto - oncogenes in leukaemias and lymphomas , they have also helped to unleash a surprisingly violent controversy about how the proto - oncogene is @activated@ . Harvard 's experiments on bird tumours , for example , showed that viral insertion increased the expression of the myc gene and Croce and his collaborators reported that they found increased expression of myc in Burkin 's lymphomas ( Science , vol 21 8 , p 983 ) . But others have failed to find such quantitative increases , and suspect instead that in the course of translocation , the alene is altered in a way that causes a qualitative change in its product .

In the perversion of this process that typically occurs in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells , any of three chromosomes containing the antibody genes , instead of reorganising their own DNA , exchange some DNA with chromosome 8 . This led George Klein , of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , to suggest ( Nature , vol 294 , p 213 ) that these translocations might not just @activate@ the antibody genes on the normal rearranged DNA they might also @activate@ a proto - oncogene on chromosome 8 . Klein 's suggestion was one major source of inspiration for the research that culminated in three papers in PNAS all reporting that chromosome 8 does indeed contain a proto - oncogene a gene known as myc , after the myelocytomatosis virus in which it was discovered . The other source of inspiration and indeed guidance for the research was an experiment by William Hayward and his colleagues at the Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York ( Nature , vol 290 , p 475 ) , Their work on a virus - induced lymphoma of birds inspired the researchers to look specifically for the myc gene rather than for any of the 13 other known proto - oncogenes .

activate.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Using peptide sequence information derived from purified bovine glial growth factors , we have isolated several clones that encode Schwann cell mitogenic activities . The group of proteins encoded by these transcripts includes the three described glial growth factors ( ref . 22 , and A.D.J.G . et al. , manuscript submitted ) and several proteins ( heregulins and Neu differentiation factor ) that have various activities on cultured breast tumour cells . The heregulins and NDF are specific activators of the p185 erbB2 receptor and rhGGF - II @activates@ the phosphorylation of a Schwann cell protein that is similar in size to p185 erbB2 . Based on several lines of evidence , including the data presented here , we suggest that various p185 erbB2 ligands , such as the GGFs , are important in development , regeneration and tumour formation in the nervous system . A critical stage in the development of the peripheral nervous system is the projection of axons to their targets , the ensheathment of these axons and their subsequent myelination by Schwann cells .
activate.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ The properties of cooperativity , associativity and input - specificity can now easily be explained . The cooperativity threshold follows from the need for depolarization to reduce the level of the Mg 2+ block of the NMDA channel . Weak stimuli , activating only a few fibres , fail to induce LTP not because insufficient L - glutamate is released to @activate@ NMDA receptors , but because the level of depolarization provided by the weak input does not produce an adequate reduction of the Mg 2+ block . When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus , depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels . Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ; in theory , these helper inputs could use any neurotransmitter that promotes depolarization , and , experimentally , depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .

Clearly , PLC - 1 is @activated@ by all four members of the q family ( q , 11 , 14 , and 16 ) .

A proportion of the cells without Bcl - 2 died before undergoing division , as previously described , and thus could not be scored . We excluded such cells from our analysis and studied 100 of the remaining cells , chosen at random , through their first divisions .

There is no net increase in the number of elements @activated@ by a given stimulus but the circles have been moved apart , indicating not only an increase in the number of unique elements @activated@ by a stimulus but a corresponding decrease in the number of common elements @activated@ . It is not clear if either of these possibilities accurately represents the full implications of Gibson 's ( 1969 ) differentiation theory , but both are capable of predicting the required result . * Comparing the scheme shown in fig. 5.11 ( b ) with that of Fig. 5.11 ( a ) , we might expect that the presence of the extra active a elements would produce more effective overshadowing of the c elements during training with A. Generalization to B would therefore be reduced .

activate.v 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ If we assume that the relative risk is well approximated by the odds ratio , the percentage of cases that could be attributable to this genotype was 8 % in the whole population and 35 % in the low - risk group .

ACE exists predominantly as an ectoenzyme of vascular endothelial cells and plays a key part in the renin - angiotensin and kallikrein - kinin systems by @activating@ angiotensin I into angiotensin II and inactivating bradykinin . These two peptide hormones have opposite effects on vascular tone and on smooth muscle cell proliferation , and as neointimal proliferation and vasospasm may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease , the most likely mechanism by which the ACE polymorphism affects the risk of myocardial infarction is by modulating the level of these peptides in the coronary arteries . This hypothesis is compatible with earlier results and with a study of hypertensive patients with high renin profiles , a condition likely to be associated with increased angiotensin II , who were found to be at higher risk of coronary heart disease than those with low renin profiles .

But the duration of the time - window during which kinase inhibitors are effective and the manner in which the activation of kinases is maintained are both matters of debate . For example , it has been suggested that constitutively @activated@ PKC is involved because H - 7 , which inhibits the activity of the catalytic subunit , but not sphingosine , which prevents the initial activation of PKC , can depotentiate synapses in a reversible manner even when applied up to 3h after induction . But the selectivity of H - 7 for potentiated pathways has been challenged , and other PKC inhibitors that act on the catalytic subunit , including K - 252b ( ref . 85 ) , are not able to depotentiate fully established LTP .

A stronger ( long ) serotonin stimulus causes the release of amino acids which @activate@ the NMDA receptors , leading to long term memory . A short stimulus gives only a transient NMDA elevation , but if the cells are treated with both serotonin and NMDA , then long term potentiation could be induced .

Potential targets for arachidonic acid include not only the presynaptic terminal , where it may act to increase L - glutamate release , but also glial cells where it depresses L - glutamate uptake and the postsynaptic cell , where , for example , it can potentiate NMDA receptor - mediated currents .

The interpretation of imagery , the circumstances of production , the place of the work in the artist 's career , the historical context , the precise information about the work 's appearance and condition , these are things that can be fully discussed in a monograph .

A personal friend of an artist may have a real advantage in @writing@ criticism , as he may learn about artistic intentions which are not explained to others . This places a critic in a privileged position , but also with a responsibility to make clear whether views expressed are those of the critic or those of the artist . This distinction can be limpid if the artist is directly interviewed , and the interview is verbatim ; but there are problems of evidence with filming and tape recordings , as well as with interviews , since the viewer or reader is unlikely to know how they have been edited .

When The Waste Land appeared , Untermeyer had become more irate : The Dial 's award to Mr T. S. Eliot and the subsequent bookpublication of his The Waste Land have occasioned a display of some of the most enthusiastically naive superlatives that have ever issued from publicly sophisticated iconoclasts . The poem itself he found a pompous parade of erudition , and he @decided@ that were it not for the Laforgue mechanism , Mr Eliot s poetic variations on the theme of a super - refined futility would be increasingly thin and incredibly second rate ( The Freeman , 17 January 1923 ) . Obviously a writer who is happy with super - refined ( elsewhere he says that Eliot 's Portrait of a Lady is extraordinarily sensitized ) is not a critic worth pausing on for long ; and yet when Untermeyer cites all too patent imitations of Eliot 's Sweeney Among the Nightingales in quatrains by Osbert Sitwell and Herbert Read and Robert Nichols , one can see good reason for him to think that Eliot s reputation , achieved so fast on such a slender body of work , was no more than modish . And indeed it asks no great exertion of the historical imagination to recognize that , at a time when the Sitwells were taken to be modernists equal with Eliot and Pound , modish was just what Eliot 's reputation was .

But when I looked over those I had kept , I @decided@ I could not do so . If many of Hewlett 's correspondents felt as Mrs Lowndes did , this explains why Hewlett 's letters as edited by Laurence Binyon ( 1925 ) make such unexciting reading ; she herself records that of the three hundred letters printed by Binyon there was only one which I felt to be characteristic of the man I knew so well .

Fraser 's book is not without its evident presuppositions , and not every reader will feel that this autobiographer , having perused and digested his tape - recordings , talked to his analyst and completed his inner and outer voyages , knew something radically different about his past from what he had known before : that something had been found , or proved .

decide.v 0 0 0 0 0 @ Like Mount Kenya , Elgon is the remains of an ancient volcano , and rises as a gigantic dome high above the surrounding plains . At the crest of the dome is a large crater ( more correctly called caldera ) , with its rim surmounted by a circle of large , steep - sided , flat - topped peaks . The highest of these peaks , Wagagai ( 14,177ft/4321m ) , is in Ugandan territory and officially out of bounds , but our map showed the international boundary passing through the summit of the second highest peak ( just 20 metres lower than Wagagai ) , called Lower Elgon , so we @decided@ to stay legal and aim for that instead . Part of Mount Elgon is a national park , a protected area for several species of animals , including elephant and buffalo . Remembering the close encounter near Maralal , we arranged for an armed park ranger to accompany us , so that we would also be protected in case of emergency .

Through the daily use of our special knowledge of the counter - culture , we were forced to acknowledge and come to grips with many of the complex social factors surrounding some drug use , which a legal framework could never adequately encompass . We now had to grapple with problems of ethics , with questions of morality and of personal philosophy , as we tried to draw a @simple@ police code of practice together to frame those new deviancies created in the 1960s by the Acts of Parliament relating to drug use . Furthermore , the reading I did for the lectures I was called to give as a drugs expert generated queries about such ambiguous areas as victimless crimes and interference in private acts , and altogether raised more questions than were solved . This acquisition of special knowledge meant that when I was called to give evidence to the Advisory Council on Drug Abuse ( chaired by Baroness Wooton ) on the use of cannabis , I was perhaps more inclined to dwell on the symbolic dangers attributed to its use than on any alleged physical harm , simply because I was now aware that any reality in relation to cannabis use was more complex than could be contained in some easy binary of social value medical debilitation .

There have been marked shifts in spending between programmes since 1979 . It is worth @noting@ , however , that the spending priorities have not been radically dissimilar from those planned by the outgoing Labour government , which also planned for cuts in spending on education and housing and an expansion in spending on defence , law and order , and social security . Table 8 . 1 above shows that between 1978 9 and 1988 9 there was a major and planned increase in real terms in spending on defence and law and order ; spending on housing and industry were heavily cut , while on education ( helped by a fall in numbers of school children ) and on transport it stayed fairly constant . For all the concern over the level of public spending the British share as a proportion of GDP in 1979 was only at the mid - point of most western states .

According to Engels the State only develops with the full elaboration of classes , and it is the tool of the ruling class enforcing its will on those whom it oppresses . This is a crucial proposition which we have already @noted@ and which will be discussed again later in this book . It is by means of this idea that the State is linked with the earlier part of the origin of kinship and marriage . Classes and private property grow out of the family and together these various factors lead to the break - up of the gens .

John Alderson made a case for the reintroduction of community policing in 1982 ( Alderson 1982 , also see 1979 ) , but its advantages were recognized much earlier when the House of Commons Select Committee on Race Relations examined relations between the police and ethnic minorities in 1972 , and in 1976 a report from the National Police College placed a central emphasis upon it ( Pope 1976 ) . But , as Weatheritt @noted@ , amid all this , there is considerable confusion over what analysts mean by the concept community policing ( Weatheritt 1983 ; also see Hartmann et al . 1988 ; Trojamowicz and Moore 1988 ) . It has been loosely referred to as any mode of policing other than the rapid - response crime control type ; an alternative which specifically seeks to make constables part of the community by making them responsible for a geographical area , known as permanent or home beats ; a means of developing communication between the police and the local community ; and a process by which responsibility for crime control and prevention is shared with the community , both also known as community relations ( Weatheritt 1983 : 45 ) .

note.v 0 0 0 0 @ This second and logically distinct , rhetorical use of anthropological material is never completely separate from the historical use , and the mixture of the two became , as we shall see , the source of many problems . The rhetorical use of anthropology inevitably involved Marx and Engels in a search of the anthropological literature for examples of opposites to the institutions of capitalism . Since their work focused on certain topics it was natural that they particularly looked for evidence relating to these topics , and as examples of the rhetorical use of anthropology three such central topics can be @noted@ here in a preliminary way . These are the relationships existing between people engaged in the process of production , the relations of production , property and the family . Marx 's work in Capital is focused on the nature of the social relationship which existed between workers and capitalists : the capitalist relations of production .

National brewing giants such as Allied or Whitbread , though , are not the only villains ; small independent firms can be just as insensitive in their treatment of their tied houses . Claire Hunt , for instance , @noted@ in 1988 of North Western brewers Robinsons that they appear on the whole to be fairly oblivious to the individual merits of their historic pubs . One key problem with the more domestically - scaled Georgian pubs is that they were often originally conceived as , or converted from , modest homes .

On a mixed farm , there would be a larger number of buildings for cattle , while on a pastoral farm the reduced need for waggon horses caused the stables to be small and there would be little accommodation for crops . It is interesting to @note@ that sheep had almost no effect on the form of the farmstead as buildings were very rarely provided for them . Where land was readily acquired so that the farmstead could be enlarged in a logical way , rather than the haphazard development which resulted from the erection of buildings on whatever sites became available , individual buildings within the grouping were sited so as to maximise efficiency .

It is also important to @note@ that they saw the taking of law into their own hands as temporary , and pending the recognition by that state of its mistaken attitude towards them and their right to a degree of autonomy .

Inevitably , I @noted@ these criticisms were rarely in relation to what he had said ( few had actually read the book ) , but rather were expressions of shocked outrage that he had failed to keep silent and say nothing at all . Indeed , the fact that he had apparently used an editor from a Manchester newspaper for some of his purposes was latched onto and quoted as a sign that he was suspect and disloyal . One consequence of these modes of thought is that the service has to live out a continuous and enormous paradox .

note.v 0 0 0 0 @ A further consideration about feminist criticism , is that it is more practical than theoretical , in a familiar English way , and that unlike other schools in the rainbow coalition , it is actively concerned in producing readings of particular texts . Most of them are produced by women , who provide insights that come from relating female experience to a body of writing ; logically , there is no reason why these insights should not be available to male critics with the right sympathies and sensibility , but in practice most of this criticism is by women . Such criticism , it is worth @noting@ , is basically mimetic ; literature is assumed to relate to experience . Feminist criticism , like Marxist , is avowedly evaluative , which sharply distinguishes it from the generality of current academic criticism , of whatever school . This is desirable in itself , though I do not warm to the feminist MacCarthyism which subjects texts to a close , hostile interrogation in a search for sexist attitudes .

There is some evidence that it was Snowden who suggested the formula of the doctor 's mandate , at a Cabinet meeting on 5 October , under which the component parts of the National Government were each to issue their own manifestos , with a separate personal appeal from the Prime Minister , According to Neville Chamberlain , Snowden produced the suggestion that the Prime Minister should issue his own manifesto asking for a free hand i.e. on tariffs and the two Party leaders should each issue their own programmes and to our astonishment this was at once accepted by the Liberals , ' Amery , who perhaps got the information from Chamberlain , wrote in his diary on 6 October , Apparently when the deadlock seemed most complete Snowden suggested that the PM should issue his own manifesto , each of the other party leaders issuing theirs . ' Tom Jones , whose source was Lothian , also said that the formula was Snowden 's . It is ironic that , after the National majority had been safely won , and shown itself , as might have been predicted , protectionist , Snowden reverted to the role of stubborn free trader , and gave currency to the view of MacDonald as a feeble halfwit , without principles or dignity , Yet MacDonald , although no doctrinaire free trader , had fought harder to reach a formula that the Liberals , Snowden 's free trade allies , could accept than Snowden himself had done .

note.v 0 0 0 0 @ In parallel with the Republic , class politics has flourished even less on the protestant loyalist side , despite the periodic strength of protestant trade unionism ( Patterson 1980 ) . There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ; but it had been based on industrial workers , particularly in the shipyards , and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart . As Gibbon has @noted@ , the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles ( 1975 : 3 ) . The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic nationalist and protestant loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes appear to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions . By providing core beliefs , and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances , religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions , become embroiled in cementing alliances , and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

In this , Ancient Society resembled the other evolutionary schemes for the history of mankind which we have just @noted@ . However , Ancient Society also differed from earlier work because of the high quality of the scholarly work on which it was based , because of the sympathy of the writer for primitives , and because it not only defined stages but in many cases suggested mechanisms which explained why one stage should change to another .

As we can now see , the displacing of the linear and quasi - geometrical as the dominant mode in New York ( and Parisian ) abstract art after 1943 offers another instance of that cyclical alternation of non - painterly , or linear , and painterly which has marked the evolution of Western art since the sixteenth century .

The three or four terms offered to post - graduate students condense the technical work of a three - year course ; on the whole there is greater emphasis on training the voice , movement , acting technique , fencing and dance , etc. since students will presumably have developed a fair amount of performing skill through their university drama departments or societies . This @means@ that there is usually only one show - case production at the end of the year for agent and production managements to see . The one - year course is only to lay down the foundations of good technical training and it is widely recognised that the course simply pushes the student into the profession with enough practical experience to find his or her feet .

Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate , they @meant@ they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state . But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation . In addition , the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships , doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .

difference.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ By JOHN PIENAAR IF THIS WEEK'S striking display of Labour unity was more show than substance , there was no sign of it among the party 's other ranks as they dispersed in buoyant mood from Brighton . All around the conference centre , the message was the same from all but the largely isolated activists of the hard - left : @differences@ on the detail of Neil Kinnock 's policy review took second place to its status as Labour 's only route - map to political power . Dread of failure , as much as positive enthusiasm for Labour 's change of direction , was a driving motivation for offering the most appealing face possible at the next election . Constituency Labour Party and trade union delegates seized eagerly on the common feeling that the Conservatives economic and political trials , and the disarray of the centre parties , were at last combining to open a window of opportunity .

The capture of the village yesterday evening did not make much @difference@ to our situation in and around the village . The enemy , it appears , have withdrawn a short distance from the area in front of 6 Commando , the front being just the same in front of the other Commando units .

In Spain Real Madrid now lead on goal @difference@ from Atletico Madrid and Sevilla after a 4 - 1 win over Cadiz , Hugo Sanchez scoring two and Bernd Schuster one .

But in the mid - 1970s there was an acrimonious conflict between the different intelligence gathering agencies in the province . Matters became so serious that in August 1979 Sir Maurice Oldfield , the former Chief of MI6 and model for John Le Carre 's fictional spy master George Smiley was sent to Northern Ireland to cover the @differences@ between MI6 , MI5 , Army intelligence and the RUC . Sir Maurice reportedly decided to reduce MI6 's role in Ireland , although it still conducted operations on the continent and against IRA gun runners in North America . During the 1970s intelligence organisations were often reluctant to share information from their best informants .

In addressing itself to such possibilities , however , A Bend in the River , for all its air of simplicity , is never simple . Its narrator and chief human presence is by no means straightforwardly a victim , and the @difference@ between oppressor and oppressed can be hard to identify . The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin , whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa , as traders . Salim leaves them , takes off on the first of a series of flights , and treks to the interior , to a country which appears to be compounded of the Congo and of Uganda , in order to earn a living from a store which he has acquired from a man whose daughter he is expected to marry one day .

He was a delightful colleague , amusing and sympathetic , and his suicide in 1973 in his early fifties came as a shock to his many friends . His letters to his daughter Amanda , accompanied by her explanatory editorial notes , reveal him to have been something of a tender tyrant in his dealings with his three children , and much happier in the country watching birds than in London coping with editors and producers .

We would like to point out that many people at the centre told us that the attitudes we had @encountered@ were less prevalent now than they had been in the past , and would continue to diminish . We were introduced to both PADI and BSAC divers who without exception , apologised on behalf of BSAC . We have not yet come across anyone who has been able to offer a reasonable explanation for a rather disheartening introduction to diving .

In a game the pain of life can safely be recaptured , @encountered@ and switched off as required , for as we have seen , a game and all other forms of playing including the arts are deliberately created second - order experiences , removed from the rawness of living . The substance of the playing is an abstraction . In hide - and - seek , a number of people agree for a period of time to abstract from living what they know of the hiding function ( i.e. that people can be hiders and seekers and that places can be hiding places ) and to behave , for the time being , as if only that function mattered .

None of these structures competes with the others which is perhaps why they work as a trio . ALTHOUGH the Hungarian restaurants in which I ate did achieve a far higher standard than anything I @encountered@ in Prague , almost all had in common a poor sense of presentation and good ingredients were often spoiled by ignorance and negligence . A piece of venison , for example , had not been properly trimmed of its silverskin so that in cooking , the silverskin contracted , warping the meat which therefore cooked unevenly . Where high - quality cuisine is regarded as a wicked , capitalist indulgence for the rich , it is , I suppose , inevitable , that the necessary skills should have decayed and lapsed .

We begin to see that life is too vast and too mysterious to be flattened into cheap explanations . Perhaps we have actually known that God has @encountered@ us personally . Nothing else explains the conviction we have that we have heard him speak to us . Awed by this , we have naturally developed an awareness of the transcendent .

At the first , input - process level , we do not @encounter@ philosophical problems in the classic sense : these are problems of mental engineering , of cognitive science in the current jargon . However , the problem at the cognisance level is to describe how a history of activity ( that is , intentional changes in informational content ) results in the conceptions which we have about our mental life . It hardly needs saying that how this story is told will depend upon philosophical argument .

What sense can be made of divine as opposed to human personality ? Once we try to lift the imagination away from the idea of God as a person ( another unfortunate implication of the old man on a cloud motif ) into another form of personality , we @encounter@ a number of interesting arguments . Clearly a great deal of what religious traditions have to say about the Deity presupposes a personal God . We think of a being who shows various emotions towards creation love , wrath , anger , sorrow , mercy and so on and who is associated with particular activities that we think of as actions taken by persons , such as judgement .

Popularly known as the Parliamentary Ombudsman , Sir Anthony has been surprisingly open about his work given the secrecy that pervades Whitehall . Firm judgments of the cases he has investigated have often been accompanied by hard - hitting comments about the problems his office has @encountered@ . This is very much a product of his legal background which , in a career spanning 40 years as a lawyer , has seen him spurn a more lucrative profession to concentrate on the injusticesthat accompany bureaucracies like the Civil Service . Born in 1924 , his ambitions were delayed by the outbreak of the second world war in which he served in the Royal Naval Reserve from 1943 , first in Coastal Forces and then on minesweepers , rising to the rank of lieutenant before being demobilised three years later .

A recent Institute of Directors ' survey of 200 successful female executives found that of the 87 per cent who claimed to have @encountered@ career obstacles not experienced by male colleagues , difficulty with childcare , at 37 per cent , was the biggest factor .

Other problems were @encountered@ , including background noise , the positioning of the shorthand writer , overcrowding in many rooms when a politically interesting meeting was being filmed , and the arrangements for covering committee meetings away from Westminster .

encounter.v 0 0 0 0 0 @ This is a crucial and extremely innovative part of the Highlander education system , and it is worth spending a little time stressing the importance of this . An initial reaction by the Highlander staff to an approach from a new community group may be to show them a video made by another similar community group about their own activities , then possibly video the reactions of the new group to what they have seen . The experiences of other people who are in a similar situation are used to convey to the new group a sense of purpose and to reduce the feelings of helplessness and isolation which are often @encountered@ . Frequently many rural communities are faced with more than their physical and geographical isolation . There is also a cultural and intellectual isolation from those who exercise power through participating in the decision - making process , and the majority who are effectively excluded .

Our choice was one which policemen and women from areas of high tension could not appreciate . People from the stations we visited in such areas , or whom we @encountered@ upon their being transferred to Easton , felt policing there was not typical and that we were obtaining an unrealistic view . As one said , what Easton has , unlike many areas , is ordinary civil policing ( FN 16/11/87 , p. 6 ) , so that there is a continuity with policing in Easton before the current troubles began : I was in Easton years ago when it was the old station , though basically policing at Easton has n't changed from when I was here years ago. It 's still ordinary policing , though the station and the set - up within it has changed ( FN 17/12/87 , p. 1 ) .

But in addition to these primary typifications there are a large number of more contextually specific typifications whose use has a less general purpose . This might be because the people to whom they apply are @encountered@ only infrequently in the course of police work . Examples here are typifications of judges ( hard , soft , fair ) , solicitors ( clever , stupid ) , rape victims ( pure , asking for it , good - time girls ) , the typification common - law job for children born out of wedlock , and old dear for friendly female pensioners . Another reason for the more restricted use of these sorts of typification is that the situations in which they become operative are infrequent , such as the typifications old biddies or old dolls for pensioners who make petty complaints , Easton funny for strange and odd events , and loopers for odd and strange people .
encounter.v 0 0 0 0 0 @ What is it to claim authority or to accept that someone has authority over one ? It means to believe that one has legitimate authority , or that that person has authority over one . Here we @encounter@ one of the main differences between normative - explanatory accounts such as the ones offered here of authority or the later account ( in Chapter 7 ) of rights , and the purely linguistic explanations often advocated by analytic philosophers . A purely linguistic account of authority claims to yield a simple explanation of what people believe who believe that someone has legitimate authority . Had the above account been a linguistic account , an explanation of the meaning of legitimate authority , it would have followed that anyone who believes of a person that he has legitimate authority believes that that person satisfies the condition set by the justification thesis .

Since Karajan had a love - hate relationship with the camera , loathing its intrusions into music - making in the concert hall and uneasy with formal portraits , Steiner 's observations have to be seen in their context , though it is undoubtedly the case that there was a quality of coolness and detachment about Karajan that shaped some of his music - making and made him , among other things , so formidable an interpreter of Sibelius and late Mahler .

plan.n 0 0 0 0 @ A final chapter is devoted to four case studies : Michael Erhart of Ulm , Tilmann Riemenschneider of Wurzburg , Veit Stoss of Nuremberg , and Hans Leinberger of Landshut . These short studies are in part historical , but partly art criticism ; the study of Leinberger is particularly relevant , as it comments both on an encounter with a sculpture and the problems of reading about it . The best preliminary @plan@ may be for the reader to open the book upright at ( the illustration ) and then go to the other side of the room , to be imposed on from a distance : it is the nearest the book can offer to the proper first encounter with the figure . There is no one way of looking at a sculpture by Leinberger and similarly there is no one angle or distance from which we see it anything like whole , but there is something like a normal sequence of approach . This begins with the figure impinging powerfully from a distance , in this case as one walks into St Martin 's at Landshut , more powerfully than other things in the field of view .

plan.n 0 0 0 0 @ Although no detailed plans are necessary , you will be required to provide a location plan showing the siting of your building , the boundaries of the site and particulars of any drainage works . Once a Building Notice has been submitted and accepted by your council you can start work within 48 hours . As there are no @plans@ to examine , the council is not obliged to issue any formal letter of approval . Compliance with the Building Regulations is enforced by means of site inspections during the progress of the work . A question which is often asked is , Are there any risks involved in using the quicker procedure of submitting a Building Notice rather than depositing full plans ?
plan.n 0 0 0 0 @ The MBO team , heavily supported by CAMRA , is still negotiating a similar deal . Although Brent Walker says the MBO is the preferred option , negotiations are complicated by Brent Walker 's precarious financial position . A restructuring @plan@ , put forward by the 47 banks owed 1.5 billion by Brent Walker , needed the approval of 75 per cent of the company 's bondholders . Meanwhile the Serious Fraud Squad is continuing its investigations into the company 's affairs . Stout fellow feels the strain
